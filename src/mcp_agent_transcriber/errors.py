"""
errors.py — safe error boundary
================================
The single channel through which unexpected tool exceptions reach the model.

Full tracebacks contain file paths and internal state — none of which belongs
in the model's context window. tool_error() logs the full exception
server-side (exc_info=True) and returns only the tool name and exception
class name to the caller.

Known, reproducible conditions (private video, disabled captions, unknown
platform ...) are decoded into static, path-free failure payloads by the
domain modules instead of being raised here.
